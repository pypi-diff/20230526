-        Returns all the greeks details for the specified option identifier. Greeks provide quantifiable factors for measuring the option's price sensativity. Greeks include -  |Greek|Description| |---|---| |Delta| The ratio comparing the change in the price of the underlying asset to the corresponding change in the price of a derivative. Sometimes referred to as the \"hedge ratio\". For example, with respect to call options, a delta of 0.7 means that for every $1 the underlying stock increases, the call option will increase by $0.70. Put option deltas, on the other hand, will be negative, because as the underlying security increases, the value of the option will decrease. So a put option with a delta of -0.7 will decrease by $0.70 for every $1 the underlying increases in price. As an in-the-money call option nears expiration, it will approach a delta of 1.00, and as an in-the-money put option nears expiration, it will approach a delta of -1.00.| |Gamma| The rate of change for delta with respect to the underlying asset's price. Mathematically, gamma is the first derivative of delta and is used when trying to gauge the price of an option relative to the amount it is in or out of the money. When the option being measured is deep in or out of the money, gamma is small. When the option is near the money, gamma is largest.| |Rho|The rate at which the price of a derivative changes relative to a change in the risk-free rate of interest. Rho measures the sensitivity of an option or options portfolio to a change in interest rate.| |Theta|A measure of the rate of decline in the value of an option due to the passage of time. Theta can also be referred to as the time decay on the value of an option. If everything is held constant, then the option will lose value as time moves closer to the maturity of the option. For example, if the strike price of an option is $1,150 and theta is 53.80, then in theory the value of the option will drop $53.80 per day. The measure of theta quantifies the risk that time imposes on options as options are only exercisable for a certain period of time.| |Vega|The amount that the price of an option changes compared to a 1% change in volatility. Vega changes when there are large price movements in the underlying asset and vega falls as the option gets closer to maturity. Vega can change even if there is no change in the price of the underlying asset, this would happen if there is a change in expected volatility. For example, if the vega of an option is -96.94 and if implied volatility were to rise by 1% then the option value would fall by $96.94.|  Note   * Each step in the binomial model represents a change in time, therefore, point estimates of the Greeks can be calculated for American options. The following can be used to calculate the Greeks for the Binomial Option Pricing Model (BOPM) pricing model, using the notation fstep,node so f1,1 represents the option price at the first step, top node (nodes are counted at each step starting with 0 at the bottom.

For example, if the strike price of an option is $1,150 and theta is 53.80, then in theory the value of the option will drop $53.80 per day. The measure of theta quantifies the risk that time imposes on options as options are only exercisable for a certain period of time.| |Vega|The amount that the price of an option changes compared to a 1% change in volatility. Vega changes when there are large price movements in the underlying asset and vega falls as the option gets closer to maturity. Vega can change even if there is no change in the price of the underlying asset, this would happen if there is a change in expected volatility. For example, if the vega of an option is -96.94 and if implied volatility were to rise by 1% then the option value would fall by $96.94.|  Note   * Each step in the binomial model represents a change in time, therefore, point estimates of the Greeks can be calculated for American options. The following can be used to calculate the Greeks for the Binomial Option Pricing Model (BOPM) pricing model, using the notation fstep,node so f1,1 represents the option price at the first step, top node (nodes are counted at each step starting with 0 at the bottom. See [Constructing the Tree](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/17735#tree) for more information).

+        Returns all the greeks details for the specified option identifier. Greeks provide quantifiable factors for measuring the option's price sensativity. Greeks include -  |Greek|Description| |---|---| |Delta| The ratio comparing the change in the price of the underlying asset to the corresponding change in the price of a derivative. Sometimes referred to as the \"hedge ratio\". For example, with respect to call options, a delta of 0.7 means that for every $1 the underlying stock increases, the call option will increase by $0.70. Put option deltas, on the other hand, will be negative, because as the underlying security increases, the value of the option will decrease. So a put option with a delta of -0.7 will decrease by $0.70 for every $1 the underlying increases in price. As an in-the-money call option nears expiration, it will approach a delta of 1.00, and as an in-the-money put option nears expiration, it will approach a delta of -1.00.| |Gamma| The rate of change for delta with respect to the underlying asset's price. Mathematically, gamma is the first derivative of delta and is used when trying to gauge the price of an option relative to the amount it is in or out of the money. When the option being measured is deep in or out of the money, gamma is small. When the option is near the money, gamma is largest.| |Rho|The rate at which the price of a derivative changes relative to a change in the risk-free rate of interest. Rho measures the sensitivity of an option or options portfolio to a change in interest rate.| |Theta|A measure of the rate of decline in the value of an option due to the passage of time. Theta can also be referred to as the time decay on the value of an option. If everything is held constant, then the option will lose value as time moves closer to the maturity of the option. For example, if the strike price of an option is $1,150 and theta is 53.80, then in theory the value of the option will drop $53.80 per day. The measure of theta quantifies the risk that time imposes on options as options are only exercisable for a certain period of time.| |Vega|The amount that the price of an option changes compared to a 1% change in volatility. Vega changes when there are large price movements in the underlying asset and vega falls as the option gets closer to maturity. Vega can change even if there is no change in the price of the underlying asset, this would happen if there is a change in expected volatility. For example, if the vega of an option is -96.94 and if implied volatility were to rise by 1% then the option value would fall by $96.94.|  Note   * Each step in the binomial model represents a change in time, therefore, point estimates of the Greeks can be calculated for American options.
